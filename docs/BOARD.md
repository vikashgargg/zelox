**Legend:** ✅ done+measured · 🟡 in-progress/partial · 🔴 gap/unmeasured · ⬜ backlog.
Status vs **S**=Spark, **F**=Flink: `>` beats, `=` parity, `<` behind, `?` unmeasured.

> **⭐ Milestone (2026-07-28 reconciled) — rename→zelox + PySpark 4.2 done; batch wins, streaming near-parity.**
> **Batch vs Spark: wins decisively** — 100M→S3 8.0× faster / ~3× less memory, output byte-identical
> ([RENAME42_EKS_TRIENGINE](benchmarks/RENAME42_EKS_TRIENGINE.md)). **Streaming/realtime vs Flink: near-parity,
> NOT a broad loss** — ties correctness, **wins realtime memory (7.06 vs 8.58 GiB)**, throughput **~1.07×**
> (5.37 vs 5.74M ev/s), loses slightly on bounded-path memory + latency
> ([per-pillar grounded map](design/zelox-per-pillar-grounded-map.md), reconciled). The earlier "loses 2.5× /
> memory 3.4×" framing was a **stale harness-cadence artifact — corrected**. Credit-based flow control
> (FLIP-2) is **DONE & proven** (T-BF2.4). The ONE real remaining gap is the **Kafka source consume rate**
> (FLIP-27 batch-queue measured 2.8×, EKS confirmation pending): [phase2-distributed-parity-plan](design/phase2-distributed-parity-plan.md).

## 1. Per-axis scorecard (charter axes × measured status)

| Axis | vs S | vs F | State | Evidence (measured) | Owning epic/ticket |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| **Batch throughput** | `>` | — | ✅ | P4 200M ETL: 5.92s vs Spark 36.94s = **6.2×**; TPC-H SF1 1.78 vs 63.46s | [P4](design/production-workload-benchmark.md) |
| **Streaming throughput** | — | `<` | 🟡 | Distributed gap = **Kafka source CONSUME rate** (Zelox `StreamConsumer` ~4M/s vs Flink `KafkaSource` ~10M/s); transport/shuffle/serde/JVM RULED OUT. **FLIP-27 batch-queue consume MEASURED 2.8×** (`rd_kafka_consume_batch_queue`, local 10M A/B: 1.38→3.89 M/s, identical Arrow build), kind bounded EXACT + 2.33× wall — gated `ZELOX_KAFKA_BATCH_QUEUE`. Branch `throughput/kafka-batch-queue-flip27`; EKS at-scale number pending | **VAJ-BF2** |

Root cause (traced w/ instrumentation, grounded Flink `WatermarkStatus.IDLE`): batch-queue source emitted Idle on a TRANSIENT empty drain → exchange excluded an active channel → frozen watermark.

FIXED: periodic watermarks (9cd7d05c) + `coalesce_flow_events` (276d7d8d/b1313f45). **T1+T2-free VALIDATED: 2.14× fewer Flight messages, counts EXACT** (`local_dist_coalesce_check.sh`, `kind_shuffle_coalesce_ab.sh`). T3 throughput NUMBER pending. Design: [shuffle-throughput](design/distributed-shuffle-throughput.md) | **VAJ-BF2** |
| **State mgmt** | — | `=` | ✅ | Spillable windowed-agg+join state (F5), out==N exact @5M; 64k-cap fixed | [F5](design/streaming-spillable-state-f5.md) |

**Honest one-liner (per [competitive-claims-bar]):** Zelox **beats Spark decisively on batch**
(6.2×) and is **competitive-not-categorically-better vs Flink on streaming** — parity on
correctness/EO/state/completeness, path-dependent on memory/throughput, behind on realtime
passthrough latency + still-unmeasured on e2e latency/cold-start/recovery-time. The active epic
(VAJ-BF2) targets the one structurally-beatable stage: the distributed exchange.

> **Realtime per-key correctness — TIE CONFIRMED (2026-07-21).** The 2026-07-20 "realtime key-corruption
> bug" was a **measurement artifact**: pyarrow 25.0.0 on linux-arm64 mis-decodes arrow-rs `RLE_DICTIONARY`
> int columns. The same file bytes read 1000 distinct keys (uniform 10×/key) via arrow-rs, duckdb, and
> pyarrow 16.1/18.1/21.0; only pyarrow 25.0.0 gives 944. Zelox realtime windowed-agg output is correct
> per-key end-to-end. Harness hardened with a reader-integrity guard (duckdb cross-check / pin pyarrow≤21).

## 2. Active sprint — EPIC VAJ-BF2 (distributed streaming + Arrow-Flight exchange)

**Goal:** beat Flink on streaming throughput by distributing the ranked #2 stage (exchange, 89.8s)
across nodes with no-JVM zero-copy Arrow shuffle — the only stage where Zelox can *structurally* win.
Design: [vaj-bf2-distributed-streaming.md](design/vaj-bf2-distributed-streaming.md).

**NEXT items (sprint backlog, ordered):** (1) T-BF2.8 T3 EKS A/B — the throughput NUMBER vs Flink (kind
T2 green first). (2) D3 zero-copy: Arrow `Utf8View`/`StringView` on value+shuffle columns + Flight
client-cache (Ballista) — cut residual encoder copy. (3) Helm chart (driver+worker+kafka+minio/S3, mode
toggle) for repeatable deploy. (4) Realtime passthrough throughput (batch Kafka sink). (5) Then proven-axis
board: cold-start D4, lakehouse (Delta/Iceberg), AI-native. Follow [delivery-sdlc](design/delivery-sdlc.md).

**T1 gate for T-BF2.2 (green):** unit tests gate-off→1 stage / gate-on→2 stages; `dist_streaming_smoke`
6/6 gate-ON local-cluster (`windowed_file=97` through the new shuffle) + 6/6 local; clippy `-D` green.
**Deployment parity (green):** local 6/6 · local-cluster 6/6 · kubernetes-cluster worker-launch confirmed.
**T2 result (2026-07-08, *=partial):** stage boundary cut confirmed, BUT (1) the multi-partition Kafka
benchmark is **N→M** (source parallelism = #kafka-partitions) so T-BF2.2's 1→N gate doesn't touch it
→ **T-BF2.3 is critical path**; (2) even 1→N did NOT spread — `TaskSlotAssigner::next()` fill-first-packs
a stage onto one worker → **new critical ticket T-BF2.5 (even placement)**. Cutting the boundary is
necessary but not sufficient. Kind torn down, AWS $0. Detail: [vaj-bf2 §4e](design/vaj-bf2-distributed-streaming.md).
**T2 kind (zelox:bf4):** T-BF2.6 CONFIRMED — with `worker_task_slots=2` the 8 window instances spread across
4 pods (2 each, clean even-spread p0/4 p1/5 p2/6 p3/7). At the DEFAULT slots=8 they pack on 1 pod: one worker
holds the whole 8-task region AND the region is assigned before other workers register (timing race) → **T-BF2.7**
(wait-for-workers before assigning; Spark minRegisteredResourcesRatio / Flink slot-wait). **VAJ-BF2 distribution
+ credit COMPLETE + KIND-PENETRATED, MERGED TO MAIN (2026-07-08):** T-BF2.2/2.5/2.3/2.6/2.7/2.4 all T1+T2 green
(source+exchange+window distribute across pods, dup=0 + crash-EO, credit bounds in-flight); merge gates green
(workspace test + clippy); kind penetration §4n. **Critical path now:** T3 EKS multi-node throughput vs Flink
= the BEAT measurement (scale + head-to-head, no unknowns).

- 🟡 **D5 recovery-time** timing (not just correctness) vs Flink 2.0 ForSt.
- 🔴 **Realtime Kafka→Kafka passthrough** throughput/latency (batch the Kafka sink).
- ⬜ **AI-native execution** (charter axis) — scope from Ray Data / Daft / feature-pipeline patterns.

*Maintenance: update the cell + link the commit the SAME turn work lands. This board is loaded at

- ⚙️ **[Throughput: beat Flink STRUCTURAL board](design/throughput-beat-flink-board.md)** (2026-07-12) — ROOT CAUSE (code-verified): every streaming operator DECODEs input + ENCODEs output FlowEvent (marker-col alloc + per-row scan) ~5-6x/batch; Flink CHAINS operators (zero re-encode). THE per-batch tax that eats the columnar/no-JVM edge. Tasks T-1 (kill per-operator encode/decode = P0) → T-5 (cold-start), each profile-gated.
